# SQL_Employee-Management-System
Design and query a database for "ABC" a mid-sized company aiming to manage employee data efficiently. The system should store details about employees, their departments, projects, salaries, and attendance, with additional constraints to ensure data integrity.

**General Instructions :**
1.Referential Integrity: Ensure that all foreign key relationships are defined correctly between the tables.
2.Normalization: Ensure that the tables are normalized (at least 3NF), i.e., no repeating groups, no partial
dependencies, and no transitive dependencies.
3.Constraints: Apply necessary constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT values as
specified.
4.Data Integrity: Handle scenarios like managing employees without a manager (nullable ManagerID),
and ensure attendance status has valid options ('Present', 'Absent', 'Leave').
